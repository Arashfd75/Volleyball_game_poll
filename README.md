# Volleyball_game_poll
## What is this project about?
There were 24 people inculding me who wanted play volleyball. As you may know, volleyball is played in teams of 6. So, there was an argue over the number of teams:
1. 3 teams of 8 (2 substitue players)
2. 4 teams of 6 (No substitutuions)

At first mose people were thinking that the first option (3 teams) would be more efficient and they suggested to do the substitutions each 6 points. However, I was of the opinion that I may not be fair for all players, so I decided to do some simulations and visualizations.
